## How to add to the archiver

When retiring a repo:

1. Clone the repo and copy its contents (excluding `.git/`) into a new subdirectory named after the original repo
2. Add a row to the table above
3. Commit directly to `main` (no PRs needed — this is an archive, not active code)
4. Delete the original GitHub repo
5. Update [IN-210](https://linear.app/inductive-network/issue/IN-210/codatta-github-repository-cleanup-monorepo-migration) with the completed status
